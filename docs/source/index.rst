Welcome to TopologyPy's documentation!
======================================

**TopologyPy** is a Python package for computing CMB covariance matrices for non-trivial topologies, such as the 3-torus (E1) and other topologies (E2â€“E10). Developed by Amirhossein Samandar under the auspices of the COMPACT Collaboration, it supports temperature and polarization calculations, leveraging CAMB for cosmological simulations.
